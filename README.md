# E06a-Bullets
Playing with bullet sprites:

I have edited the code to allow for the narwhal to shoot bullets at the penguins, and once the penguin hp reaches 0 they are then killed, and taken off the screen.

I have yet to find out how to display a winning condition once all the penguins are killed.
